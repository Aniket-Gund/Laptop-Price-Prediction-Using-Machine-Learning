Project Overview:

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning pipeline to predict laptop prices based on hardware specifications and configuration features. The system processes raw laptop data, performs data validation and transformation, trains multiple models, evaluates their performance, and deploys the best-performing model for prediction.

The project is designed using a modular pipeline architecture to simulate an industry-level ML workflow, including data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

-----

Problem Statement

Laptop prices vary significantly depending on specifications such as processor type, RAM, storage, GPU, screen size, and brand. Manually estimating a fair laptop price based on specifications is difficult.

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a laptop based on its features.

Machine Learning Workflow

The project follows these steps:

1 Data Ingestion

Loads the raw dataset and stores it in the artifacts directory.

2 Data Validation

Validates dataset structure, schema, and missing values.

3 Data Transformation

Performs preprocessing such as:

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling

Feature selection

4 Model Training

Multiple regression models are trained and compared.

5 Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated based on performance metrics, and the best model is selected.

6 Model Pushing

The best model is saved for future predictions.

----

Model Output

The trained model and preprocessing pipeline are stored in the artifacts folder.
